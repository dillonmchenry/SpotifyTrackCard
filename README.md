# Spotify Track Card

This project visualizes data from Spotify songs as the user is listening to them.

The App uses Spotify's `Web Player SDK` to host a user's listening session and extract basic information about the current track.
Further audio data and analysis is collected from calls to Spotify's `Web API`.
